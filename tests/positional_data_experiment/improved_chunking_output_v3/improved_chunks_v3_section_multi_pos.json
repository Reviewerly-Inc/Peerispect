Crucially, Idea 1 does not exploit information from action traces, so we expect that incorporating our other proposed methods will further improve results across all domains. An additional insight concerns the number of repairs returned by the LLM: it is lower than the baseline in some domains and higher in others.

Given this sizes, we do not expect the LLM alone to exploit trace information reliably, and we believe integrating the LLM with hitting-set methods that consume traces is therefore essential for consistent gains.\nIdea 3. Combine LLM proposals with minimality via the hitting-set solver. After exposing the full domain for context, we query the LLM for a list of plausible repairs at the action level. The hitting-set solver then selects a cardinalityminimal subset, ensuring that the final repairs are optimized toward consistency across conflicts. This separation allows the LLM to focus on local, per-action suggestions, avoiding confusion from reasoning over global repair sets, while the optimization stage consolidates them.

For each positive trace, one of the unsatisfied preconditions (if any) encountered along the run in each trace is recorded as a flaw . For a negative trace ( \u03c0 -k , i k ) , a flaw is recorded if the action at index i k in \u03c0 -k is applicable. If some earlier action at index j < i k is inapplicable, the trace is handled analogously to a positive one: repairs are generated so that the prefix becomes executable and the first inapplicable action occurs exactly at position i k .\nFor each flaw, the algorithm enumerates a finite set of candidate repairs. The set of candidates for a single flaw is called a conflict ; at least one element of the conflict must be selected to eliminate that flaw. Consider a missing positive precondition p m for action a 3 in the sequence \u03b3 = \u27e8 a 1 , a 2 , a 3 \u27e9 , and suppose a 1 has p m in its negative effects. The repair candidates include: (i) remove the missing precondition from a 3 , that is r 1 J a 3 , p m , prec + , -K for some \u03f1 so that a 3 = a 3 [ \u03f1 ] and p m = p m [ \u03f1 ] ; (ii) add p m to the positive effects of a 2 , that is r 2 J a 2 , p m , eff + , + K whenever a matching \u03f1 such that a 2 = a 2 [ \u03f1 ] and p m = p m [ \u03f1 ] ; exists; (iii) remove p m from the negative effects of a 1 , that is r 3 J a 1 , p m , eff -, -K for some \u03f1 so that a 1 = a 1 [ \u03f1 ] and p m = p m [ \u03f1 ] ;. These give a conflict \u03b8 = { r 1 , r 2 , r 3 } .\nThe baseline does not exploit semantic cues encoded by the modeller in predicate, action, or domain names within the PDDL file.
