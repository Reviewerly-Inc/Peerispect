      "text": "ABSTRACT\nInformation retrieval (IR) plays a crucial role in locating relevant resources from vast amounts of data, and its applications have evolved from traditional knowledge bases to modern retrieval models (RMs). The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further revolutionized the IR field by enabling users to interact with search systems in natural languages. In this paper, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs and RMs, highlighting their respective strengths in understanding user-issued queries and retrieving up-to-date information. To leverage the benefits of both paradigms while circumventing their limitations, we propose InteR , a novel framework that facilitates information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs. InteR allows RMs to expand knowledge in queries using LLM-generated knowledge collections and enables LLMs to enhance prompt formulation using retrieved documents. This iterative refinement process augments the inputs of RMs and LLMs, leading to more accurate retrieval. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks demonstrate that InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment.\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nGenerate\nGenerate\nPrompt formulation\nRM\nLLM\nh\nh",

      "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\nInformation retrieval (IR) is an indispensable technique for locating relevant resources in a vast sea of data given ad-hoc queries (Mogotsi, 2010). It is a core component in knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering (Karpukhin et al., 2020), entity linking (Gillick et al., 2019) and fact verification (Thorne et al., 2018). Over the years, the techniques of information retrieval have evolved significantly: from the traditional knowledge base (KB) (Lan et al., 2021; Gaur et al., 2022) to modern search engines (SEs) based on neural representation learning (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Yates et al., 2021), information retrieval has become increasingly important in our digital world. More recently, the emergence of cutting-edge large language models (LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Bard (Google, 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b)) has further revolutionized the NLP community and given intriguing insights into IR applications as users can now interact with search systems in natural languages.\n1\n2\n3\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nRM\nLLM\n4\n2\n4\n8\n10\nh\n2\n4\n8\n10\nh\n8\n9\n10\nOver the decades, search engines like Google or Bing have become a staple for people looking to retrieve information on a variety of topics, allowing users to quickly sift through millions of documents to find the information they need by providing keywords or a query. Spurred by advancements in scale, LLMs have now exhibited the ability to undertake a variety of NLP tasks in a zero-shot scenario (Qin et al., 2023) by following instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Therefore, they could serve as an alternative option for people to obtain information directly by posing a question or query in natural languages (OpenAI, 2022), instead of relying on specific keywords. For example, suppose a student is looking to write a research paper on the history of jazz music . They could type in keywords such as 'history of jazz' or 'jazz pioneers' to retrieve relevant articles and sources. However, with LLMs, this student could pose a question like 'Who were the key pioneers of jazz music, and how did they influence the genre?' The LLMs could then generate a summary of the relevant information and sources, potentially saving time and effort in sifting through search results.\n2\n3\nQuery\nGenerate\nGenerate\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nLLM\n2\nh\n2\nh",

On the other hand, even MS-MARCO has limitations on commercial use and cannot be used in a wide range of real-world applications. To this end, recent work (Gao et al., 2023) proposes building zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision (i.e., relevance label between a pair of query and document), which is considered 'unsupervised' as the only supervision resides in the LLM where learning to follow instructions is conducted in earlier times (Sachan et al., 2022). In this work, we follow this zero-shot unsupervised setting and conduct information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs without any relevance supervision to handle the aforementioned issues.\n3\nQuery\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nLLM\n5\n6\n2\n6\nh\n2\n6\nh\n9\n13",

On the other hand, even MS-MARCO has limitations on commercial use and cannot be used in a wide range of real-world applications. To this end, recent work (Gao et al., 2023) proposes building zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision (i.e., relevance label between a pair of query and document), which is considered 'unsupervised' as the only supervision resides in the LLM where learning to follow instructions is conducted in earlier times (Sachan et al., 2022). In this work, we follow this zero-shot unsupervised setting and conduct information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs without any relevance supervision to handle the aforementioned issues.\n3\nQuery\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nLLM\n5\n6\n2\n6\nh\n2\n6\nh\n9\n13\n1\n2\nEnhance Retrieval Through LMs Recent works have investigated using auto-regressive language models to generate intermediate targets for better retrieval (Cao et al., 2021; Bevilacqua et al., 2022) while identifier strings still need to be created.

Given the user query q and the document set D = { d 1 , ..., d n } where n is the number of document candidates, the goal of a retrieval model (RM) is to retrieve documents that are relevant to satisfy the user's real search intent of the current query q . To accomplish such document retrieval, prior works can be categorized into two groups: sparse retrieval and dense retrieval.

Another works (Qu et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2022; Karpukhin et al., 2020) focus on dense retrieval that uses two encoding modules to map an input query q and a document d into a pair of vectors ⟨ v q , v d ⟩ , whose inner product is leveraged as a similarity function ϕ :\nQuery\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\n5\n2\nh\nMAP\n2\nh\n\\phi ( q , d ) = \\langle E _ { Q } ( q ) , E _ { D } ( d ) \\rangle = \\langle v _ { q } , v _ { d } \\rangle\nh\nh\nThen the topk documents, denoted as ¯ D that have the highest similarity scores when compared with the query q , are retrieved efficiently by RMs regardless of whether the retrieval is sparse or dense.\nQuery\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nh\nh",

Despite the remarkable text generation capability, they are also prone to hallucination and still struggle to represent the complete long tail of knowledge contained within their training corpus (Shi et al., 2023). To mitigate the aforementioned issues, we argue that ¯ D , the documents retrieved by RMs, may provide rich information about the original query q and can potentially help the LLMs make a better prediction.\n2\nh\n2\nh\nSpecifically, we include the knowledge in ¯ D into p by designing a new prompt as:\nh\nh\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\n{{query} and its possible answering passages {passages}\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nGive a question {query} Please write a correct answering passage:\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nwhere '{query}' and '{passages}' are the placeholders for q and ¯ D respectively from last RM step:\nh\nh\ns = G ( q ^ { \\prime } ) = G ( q \\oplus p \\oplus \\bar { D } )\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nRM\nLLM\nNow the query q ′ is refined and contains more plentiful information about q through retrieved documents ¯ D as demonstrations.

This iterative procedure can be interpreted as exploiting the current query q and previous-generated knowledge collection S to retrieve another document set ¯ D with RM part for the subsequent stage of LLM step. Then, the LLM part leverages the retrieved documents ¯ D from previous stage of RM and synthesizes the knowledge collection S for next RM step. A critical point is that we take LLM as the starting point and use only q and let ¯ D be empty as the initial RM input. Therefore, the prompt of first LLM step is formulated as:\nh\nh\nPlease write a passage to answer the question.\n    Question: {query}\n    Passage:\nh\nh\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nQuery\nPlease write a passage to answer the question.\n    Question: {query}\n    Passage:\nGive a question {query} Please write a correct answering passage:\nPlease write a passage to answer the question.\n    Question: {query}\n    Passage:\nWe propose using an iterative IR pipeline, with each iteration consisting of the four steps listed below:\nh\nh\n1\nGenerate\nGenerate\nRM\nLLM\n4\nInvoke LLM to conditionally generate knowledge collection S with prompt q ′ on Eq. 4.

Besides, we also use six diverse low-resource retrieval datasets from the BEIR benchmark (Thakur et al., 2021) consistent with (Gao et al., 2023) including SciFact (fact-checking), ArguAna (argument retrieval), TREC-COVID (bio-medical IR), FiQA (financial question-answering), DBPedia (entity retrieval), and TREC-NEWS (news retrieval). It is worth pointing out that we do not employ any training query-document pairs, as we conduct retrieval in a zero-shot setting and directly evaluate our proposed method on these test sets. Consistent with prior works, we report MAP, nDCG@10, and Recall@1000 (R@1k) for TREC DL'19 and DL'20 data, and nDCG@10 is employed for all datasets in the BEIR benchmark.\n6\n2\n6\n10\nh\nMAP\n2\n6\n10\nh\nnDCG@10\n9\n10",

In the case of closed-source models, we employ the gpt-3.5-turbo , as it is popular and accessible to the general public 3 . As for the open-source models, our choice fell upon the Vicuna models (Chiang et al., 2023) derived from instruction tuning with LLaMa-1/2 (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). Specifically, we assessed the most promising 13B version of Vicuna from LLaMa-2, namely, Vicuna-13B-v1.5 . Additionally, we evaluated the current best-performing 33B version of Vicuna derived from LLaMa-1, which is Vicuna-33B-v1.3 . As for the RM part, we consider BM25 for retrieval since it is much faster. For each q ′ , we sample h = 10 knowledge examples via LLM. After hyper-parameter search on validation sets, we set k as 15 for gpt-3.5-turbo , and 5 for Vicuna-13B-v1.5 and Vicuna-33B-v1.3 .

Firstly, we find that InteR is especially competent on TREC-COVID and TREC-NEWS and even significantly outperforms baselines with relevance judgment. Secondly, InteR also brings considerable improvements to baselines on SciFact and DBPedia, which shows our performance advantages on fact-checking and entity retrieval. Finally, it can be observed that the performance of FiQA and ArguAna falls short when compared to the baseline models. This could potentially be attributed to the LLM's limited financial knowledge of FiQA and the RM's marginal qualification to effectively handle relatively longer queries for ArguAna (Thakur et al., 2021).\n2\nh\n2\nh\n1\n2\n3\nRM\n5\nFigure 2: Performance of InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo across different size of knowledge collection ( h ) on TREC DL'19 and DL'20.\n2\nh\n2\nh\n9\n1\n2\n3\nRM\n5\n2\nh\n2\nh\nTable 3: Performance of InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo across different number of knowledge refinement iterations ( M ) on TREC DL'19 and DL'20.

Figure 2 illustrates the changes in MAP and nDCG@10 curves of InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo on TREC DL'19 and DL'20, with respect to varying numbers of knowledge examples. Our observations reveal a consistent pattern in both benchmarks: as the number of generated knowledge increases, the performance metrics demonstrate a gradual improvement until reaching 10 knowledge examples. Subsequently, the performance metrics stabilize, indicating that additional knowledge examples do not significantly enhance the results. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of redundant knowledge within the surplus examples generated by LLMs.\n9\n10\n2\n3\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nGenerate\nGenerate\nRM\nLLM\n5\n2\nh\n2\nh\nThe impact of the number of information refinement iterations ( M ) We also investigated the effect of different numbers of information refinement iterations ( M ) on the performance of InteR.

Thai food presentation is among the most exquisite in the world, developed primarily in the palace to please the King of Siam. Thai people love to have fun together and often ask each other if they had a good time. The population of Thailand is approximately 67.5 million people, including ethnic groups such as Chinese, Malay, Lao, Burma, Cambodia, and Indians. Unemployment rate in Thailand is relatively low, standing at 0.84% according to Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB). Thai time is divided into five sections, with different names for each section of the day. The country's primary religion is Theravada Buddhism, and important holidays include Thai New Year, or Songkran. Overall, the daily life of Thai people is diverse, vibrant and deeply rooted in their rich cultural heritage.",

By facilitating information refinement through synergy between LLMs and RMs, InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, and even those using relevance judgment, on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks. With its ability to leverage the benefits of both paradigms, InteR may present a potential direction for advancing information retrieval systems.\nRetrieval\nRetrieval\nPrompt formulation\nRM\nLLM\nh\nh\nLimitations While InteR demonstrates improved zero-shot retrieval performance, it should be noted that its effectiveness heavily relies on the quality of the used large language models (LLMs). If these underlying components contain biases, inaccuracies, or limitations in their training data, it could impact the reliability and generalizability of the retrieval results. In that case, one may need to design a more sophisticated method of information refinement, especially the prompt formulation part. We leave this exploration for future work.",
