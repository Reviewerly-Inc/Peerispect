Additionally, we introduce a hybrid retrieval paradigm that combines half of the documents from the sparse retrieval model with the other half from the dense retrieval model. These components are then merged to generate the output of the hybrid retrieval model, namely InteR (Hybrid). We can observe that the dense model is the best strategy for InteR and even outperforms the hybrid counterpart, which is consistent with the observations from prior works (Karpukhin et al., 2020). Therefore, we use a dense retrieval model to construct \u00af D as default. It is noteworthy that we only use a dense retrieval model for constructing \u00af D during information refinement and leave the final retrieval model as a sparse BM25 for efficiency.\nCase Study on LLM Outputs To better illustrate how RMs enrich the outputs of LLMs, we selected an example from TREC DL'19 and compared those outputs of gpt-3.5-turbo after the first and second iterations. Due to the limited space, we only show the first LLM-generated knowledge (i.e., s 1 ). In the initial iteration ( M = 1 ), the LLM demonstrated its capacity to generate paragraphs by leveraging its commonsense encoded within its parameters. After taking the search results of RM (documents about ' Thailand ') in the prompt, LLM outputs in the second iteration M = 2 became more informative. Specifically, the text highlighted in yellow elaborated on Thailand's population and unemployment rate , which was absent in the first iteration, and facilitated the next RM step.\nCase : query_id : 1112341, query : 'what is the daily life of thai people'",

    "text": "6 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we present InteR , a novel framework that harnesses the strengths of both large language models (LLMs) and retrieval models (RMs) to enhance information retrieval. By facilitating information refinement through synergy between LLMs and RMs, InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, and even those using relevance judgment, on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks. With its ability to leverage the benefits of both paradigms, InteR may present a potential direction for advancing information retrieval systems.\nLimitations While InteR demonstrates improved zero-shot retrieval performance, it should be noted that its effectiveness heavily relies on the quality of the used large language models (LLMs). If these underlying components contain biases, inaccuracies, or limitations in their training data, it could impact the reliability and generalizability of the retrieval results. In that case, one may need to design a more sophisticated method of information refinement, especially the prompt formulation part. We leave this exploration for future work.\n9",

Figure 2 illustrates the changes in MAP and nDCG@10 curves of InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo on TREC DL'19 and DL'20, with respect to varying numbers of knowledge examples. Our observations reveal a consistent pattern in both benchmarks: as the number of generated knowledge increases, the performance metrics demonstrate a gradual improvement until reaching 10 knowledge examples. Subsequently, the performance metrics stabilize, indicating that additional knowledge examples do not significantly enhance the results. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of redundant knowledge within the surplus examples generated by LLMs.\nThe impact of the number of information refinement iterations ( M ) We also investigated the effect of different numbers of information refinement iterations ( M ) on the performance of InteR. The results of InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo presented in Table 3 indicate a notable enhancement in retrieval capacity as M increases from 0 to 2, which verifies the effectiveness of multiple iterative information refinement between RMs and LLMs. However, if we further increase M , the performance may not improve, possibly due to a decrease in the diversity of retrieved documents from RMs. Here if we set M to 0, InteR will degenerate into BM25.\nDense retrieval v.s. sparse retrieval Furthermore, we delve into the impact of the retrieval strategy for constructing \u00af D on Eq. 4 on the performance of InteR.

    "text": "5.4 MAIN RESULTS\nWeb Search In Table 1, we show zero-shot retrieval results on TREC DL'19 and TREC DL'20 with baselines. We can find that InteR with selected LLMs can outperform state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline HyDE with significant improvement on most metrics. Specifically, InteR with gpt-3.5-turbo has an > 8% absolute MAP gain and > 5% absolute nDCG@10 gain on both web search benchmarks. Moreover, InteR is also superior to models with relevance judgment on most metrics, which verifies the generalization ability of InteR on large-scale retrieval. Note that our approach does not involve any training process and merely leverages off-the-shelf RMs and LLMs, which is simpler in practice but shown to be more effective.\nLow-Resource Retrieval In Table 2, we also present the zero-shot retrieval results on six diverse low-resource retrieval tasks from BEIR benchmarks. Firstly, we find that InteR is especially competent on TREC-COVID and TREC-NEWS and even significantly outperforms baselines with relevance judgment. Secondly, InteR also brings considerable improvements to baselines on SciFact and DBPedia, which shows our performance advantages on fact-checking and entity retrieval. Finally, it can be observed that the performance of FiQA and ArguAna falls short when compared to the baseline models. This could potentially be attributed to the LLM's limited financial knowledge of FiQA and the RM's marginal qualification to effectively handle relatively longer queries for ArguAna (Thakur et al., 2021).\n7",

As for the open-source models, our choice fell upon the Vicuna models (Chiang et al., 2023) derived from instruction tuning with LLaMa-1/2 (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). Specifically, we assessed the most promising 13B version of Vicuna from LLaMa-2, namely, Vicuna-13B-v1.5 . Additionally, we evaluated the current best-performing 33B version of Vicuna derived from LLaMa-1, which is Vicuna-33B-v1.3 . As for the RM part, we consider BM25 for retrieval since it is much faster. For each q \u2032 , we sample h = 10 knowledge examples via LLM. After hyper-parameter search on validation sets, we set k as 15 for gpt-3.5-turbo , and 5 for Vicuna-13B-v1.5 and Vicuna-33B-v1.3 .

These systems (Wang et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022) are utilized in a transfer learning configuration (Thakur et al., 2021). However, on the one hand, it is time-consuming and expensive to collect such a vast training corpus. On the other hand, even MS-MARCO has limitations on commercial use and cannot be used in a wide range of real-world applications. To this end, recent work (Gao et al., 2023) proposes building zero-shot dense retrieval systems that require no relevance supervision (i.e., relevance label between a pair of query and document), which is considered 'unsupervised' as the only supervision resides in the LLM where learning to follow instructions is conducted in earlier times (Sachan et al., 2022). In this work, we follow this zero-shot unsupervised setting and conduct information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs without any relevance supervision to handle the aforementioned issues.",

    "text": "Enhance Retrieval Through LMs Recent works have investigated using auto-regressive language models to generate intermediate targets for better retrieval (Cao et al., 2021; Bevilacqua et al., 2022) while identifier strings still need to be created. Other works consider 'retrieving' the knowledge stored in the parameters of pre-trained language models by directly generating text (Petroni et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020). Some researchers (Mao et al., 2021; Anantha et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023) utilize LM to expand the query and incorporate these pseudo-queries for enhanced retrieval while others choose to expand the document (Nogueira et al., 2019). Besides, LMs can also be exploited to provide references for retrieval targets. For instance, GENREAD (Yu et al., 2023) directly generates contextual documents for given questions.",

Some approaches enhance the accuracy of predicting the distribution of the next word during training (Borgeaud et al., 2022) or inference (Khandelwal et al., 2020) through retrieving the k-most similar training contexts. Alternative methods utilize retrieved documents to provide supplementary context in generation tasks (Joshi et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020). WebGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) further adopts imitation learning and uses human feedback in a text-based web-browsing environment to enhance the LMs. LLM-Augmentor (Peng et al., 2023) improves large language models with external knowledge and automated feedback. REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) prepends retrieved documents to the input for the frozen LM and treats the LM as a black box. Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP) (Khattab et al., 2022) obtains performance gains by relying on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between a language model and a retrieval model, which is most closely related to our approach. However, they rely on composing two parts with in-context learning and target on multi-hop question answering. While we aim at conducting information refinement via multiple interactions between RMs and LLMs for large-scale retrieval.",

    "text": "3 PRELIMINARY\nDocument Retrieval: the RM Part Zero-shot document retrieval is a crucial component of search systems. Given the user query q and the document set D = { d 1 , ..., d n } where n is the number of document candidates, the goal of a retrieval model (RM) is to retrieve documents that are relevant to satisfy the user's real search intent of the current query q . To accomplish such document retrieval, prior works can be categorized into two groups: sparse retrieval and dense retrieval. Both lines of research elaborate on devising the similarity function \u03d5 ( q, d ) for each query-document pair.\nThe sparse retrieval, e.g., TF-IDF and BM25, depends on lexicon overlap between query q and document d . This line of RMs (Zhou et al., 2022; Thakur et al., 2021) ranks documents D based on their relevance to a given query q by integrating term frequency and inverse document frequency. Another works (Qu et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2022; Karpukhin et al., 2020) focus on dense retrieval that uses two encoding modules to map an input query q and a document d into a pair of vectors \u27e8 v q , v d \u27e9 , whose inner product is leveraged as a similarity function \u03d5 :\nThen the topk documents, denoted as \u00af D that have the highest similarity scores when compared with the query q , are retrieved efficiently by RMs regardless of whether the retrieval is sparse or dense.\n3",

Both IR technologies come with their own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. LLMs excel in understanding the context and meaning behind user-issued textual queries (Mao et al., 2023), allowing for more precise retrieval of information, while RMs expect well-designed precise keywords to deliver relevant results. Moreover, LLMs have the capacity to directly generate specific answers to questions (Ouyang et al., 2022), rather than merely present a list of relevant documents, setting them apart from RMs. However, it is important to note that RMs still have significant advantages over LLMs. For instance, RMs can index a vast number of up-to-date documents (Nakano et al., 2021), whereas LLMs can only generate information that falls within the time-scope of the data they were trained on, potentially leading to hallucinated results (Shuster et al., 2021; Ji et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a;b). Additionally, RMs can conduct quick and efficient searches through a vast amount of information on the internet, making them an ideal choice for finding a wide range of data.

    "text": "To enhance IR by leveraging the benefits of RMs and LLMs while circumventing their limitations, we consider bridging these two domains. Fortunately, we observe that textual information refinement can be performed between two counterparts and boost each other. On the one hand, RMs can gather potential documents with valuable information, serving as demonstrations for LLMs. On the other hand, LLMs generate concise summaries using well-crafted prompts, expanding the initial query and improving search accuracy. To this end, we introduce InteR , a novel framework that facilitates information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs. Precisely, the RM part of InteR receives the knowledge collection from the LLM part to refine and expand the information in the query. While the LLM part involves the retrieved documents from the RM part as demonstrations to enrich the information in prompt formulation. This two-step refinement procedure can be seamlessly repeated to augment the inputs of RM and LLM. Implicitly, we assume that the outputs of both components supplement each other, leading to more accurate retrieval.\nWe evaluate InteR on public large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks following prior work (Gao et al., 2023). The experimental results show that InteR can conduct zero-shot retrieval with overall better performance than state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment 1 , and achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance.\nOverall, our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\nWe introduce InteR, a novel IR framework bridging two cutting-edge IR products, search systems and large language models, while enjoying their strengths and circumventing their limitations.\nWe propose iterative information refinement via synergy between retrieval models and large language models, resulting in improved retrieval quality.",

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further revolutionized the IR field by enabling users to interact with search systems in natural languages. In this paper, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs and RMs, highlighting their respective strengths in understanding user-issued queries and retrieving up-to-date information. To leverage the benefits of both paradigms while circumventing their limitations, we propose InteR , a novel framework that facilitates information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs. InteR allows RMs to expand knowledge in queries using LLM-generated knowledge collections and enables LLMs to enhance prompt formulation using retrieved documents. This iterative refinement process augments the inputs of RMs and LLMs, leading to more accurate retrieval. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks demonstrate that InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment.",

Over the years, the techniques of information retrieval have evolved significantly: from the traditional knowledge base (KB) (Lan et al., 2021; Gaur et al., 2022) to modern search engines (SEs) based on neural representation learning (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Yates et al., 2021), information retrieval has become increasingly important in our digital world. More recently, the emergence of cutting-edge large language models (LLMs; e.g., ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Bard (Google, 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b)) has further revolutionized the NLP community and given intriguing insights into IR applications as users can now interact with search systems in natural languages.",

    "text": "Over the decades, search engines like Google or Bing have become a staple for people looking to retrieve information on a variety of topics, allowing users to quickly sift through millions of documents to find the information they need by providing keywords or a query. Spurred by advancements in scale, LLMs have now exhibited the ability to undertake a variety of NLP tasks in a zero-shot scenario (Qin et al., 2023) by following instructions (Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Min et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Therefore, they could serve as an alternative option for people to obtain information directly by posing a question or query in natural languages (OpenAI, 2022), instead of relying on specific keywords. For example, suppose a student is looking to write a research paper on the history of jazz music . They could type in keywords such as 'history of jazz' or 'jazz pioneers' to retrieve relevant articles and sources. However, with LLMs, this student could pose a question like 'Who were the key pioneers of jazz music, and how did they influence the genre?' The LLMs could then generate a summary of the relevant information and sources, potentially saving time and effort in sifting through search results.\n1",
